# PX Ref

This is an LTZ1000-based 7V reference.

Specifically, this is my board layout of a circuit [published](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/metrology/ultra-precision-reference-ltz1000/msg249123/#msg249123) by Andreas (of the EEVBlog forum), which in turn is a modification of the 7V reference circuit from the [datasheet](http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/datasheet/1000afe.pdf).

The naming of this board was inspired by other LTZ1000 references: [KX](https://xdevs.com/article/kx-ref/), [FX](https://xdevs.com/article/792x/), [MX](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/metrology/mx-reference/), [CX](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/metrology/cx-reference/)
